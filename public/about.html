        About The Founder:
    </h1>
    <P>
        Balancing finances and filing taxes was a major issue for my family and I once arriving in the United States from Egypt. It was something like weâ€™ve never seen before despite my father having experience in working in two different countries and managing his finances alongside my mother without an issue. Living in Egypt, my parents both learned about financing at a young age through their families and had no problem with financing during their time in Egypt. Dissimilarly in the United states, they struggled with stabilizing their finances which caused them to lose out on money, and potential financial help from the government due to their lack of knowledge.
